<h3>The home of the Sky Map Generator</h3>

SMG is a program that generates a map of the sky and plots it to a file in PostScript (EPS) format.<br>
It can plot several of the main objects visible in the sky (stars, galaxies, open and globular star clusters, nebulae).<br>
It also contains algorithms for intelligent text positioning so that there are as few overlaps as possible.<br>
<p>
It is written in standard C++ which is, except for the Win32 GUI program, heavily relying on templates and the STL.<br>
For viewing the files generated with SMG you will need a PostScript interpreter such as <a target=new href="https://www.ghostscript.com/">GhostScript</a>.

New version is up. Changes include: speed improvements for text position searching (although there is still much to be desired),
globular clusters are drawn correctly now, the white rings that designate variable stars can now be switched on and off,
as well as the designations for multiple stars. The declination numbers at RA=0 are printed now.
<p>
I have also uploaded a map sample in GIF format.
